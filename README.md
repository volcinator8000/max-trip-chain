# MAX Finder

**Find every SNCF train where a free MAX JEUNE / MAX SENIOR (ex-TGVmax) seat is actually reservable — instead of checking SNCF Connect one route at a time.**

### ▶ [**Try it live — volcinator8000.github.io/max-trip-chain**](https://volcinator8000.github.io/max-trip-chain/) — no signup, runs in your browser

With a MAX JEUNE or MAX SENIOR pass, high-speed trains are free — but only when a MAX seat is still open on that train. SNCF Connect makes you check one route at a time; MAX Finder shows every station you can reach for free from a single search, using SNCF's open availability data.

Free, no account, open-source, and serverless — it runs entirely in your browser.

> Independent open-source tool — **not affiliated with SNCF, not a ticket seller**. Availability is indicative and refreshed ~daily; always confirm and book on [SNCF Connect](https://www.sncf-connect.com/).

## Search modes

- **Where to?** — every destination reachable from a station, ranked by availability.
- **Where from?** — the reverse: every origin that reaches a destination.
- **Exact trip** — one origin → destination, with connections, a 30-day availability calendar, and a round-trip finder.
- **Ideas** — the fastest destinations reachable that day.
- **Tour** — a multi-city, day-by-day itinerary, each hop on a free MAX seat.

## Features

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Connections** | Multi-leg up to 6 changes via 40 interchange stations (chosen from the data by which ones actually unlock trips), optional **Via** stopover, overnight-stopover mode |
| **Round trips & night trains** | Round trips pair the earliest-arriving outbound with the latest feasible return to maximize time there; night mode covers genuine *Intercités de Nuit* only |
| **Cheapest first** | Order results by what you'd actually pay — free, then reservation-only, then full fare. Ranked from your passes, not from prices: no open feed publishes fares |
| **Filters** | Time window, max duration, MAX JEUNE vs SENIOR, train type, region |
| **Map** | Leaflet map of every station, with correspondences plotted as intermediate points; click to select |
| **Search & share** | Explicit run (`Enter`/`g`), back nav (`Esc`), **Surprise me** random city, ICS calendar export, shareable URLs |
| **Paid trains** | An optional switch adds the trains that *run* but have no free MAX seat, badged **Paid** — so "nothing free today" comes with "…but these run" |
| **Your subscriptions** | Declare the passes you hold (MAX JEUNE/SENIOR, BahnCard, Deutschlandticket, SNCB Go Unlimited / Train+, NS OV-jaarkaart / Traject Vrij) and the free view shows only what they actually cover — including a **Reservation** state for trains a pass covers but that still charge a supplement |
| **European networks** | Optional per-country switches for **Germany (DB)**, **Belgium (SNCB)**, **Luxembourg (CFL)**, the **Netherlands (NS)** and **Spain (Renfe)**, merged into the same search — Paris → Barcelona → Madrid plans as one trip |
| **Private by default** | No accounts — favorites, settings and searches in `localStorage`; optional local notifications |
| **Everywhere** | 11 languages (FR EN ES DE IT KO ZH JA NL PT AR, incl. RTL), light/dark, installable app that works offline, mobile, accessible |

## Why it's free

Which trains have a free MAX seat is published by SNCF as open data. MAX Finder is a static frontend over it:

- A scheduled **GitHub Action** snapshots the dataset each morning into `public/data/tgvmax.json`, keeping only the trains with a free seat (~77 MB feed trimmed to ~6 MB).
- The optional extras — paid SNCF trains, and the German / Belgian / Luxembourgish / Dutch / Spanish networks built from their public GTFS feeds — are rebuilt by each deploy as compact **per-station shards** and never committed, so the repo stays small. Each station's shard holds a month of the trains that start or end there, so a search fetches the two stations it names (a few KB for most places) and gets a complete 30-day calendar from them.
- The **browser** downloads that file and runs the search on your device. (There is no live-API call at runtime: the app reads only the published snapshots, which is what lets it work offline.)
- Everything is static files on **GitHub Pages** — no backend, no database, no server cost.

## Develop

**Prereqs:** Node 20+ and npm (CI runs Node 22).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173  (uses the committed data snapshot if present, else fixture)
npm run fetch-data      # refresh the SNCF snapshot + build the paid day shards
npm run fetch-networks  # build the DE/BE/LU/NL/ES shards from their GTFS feeds (add an id to do just one)
npm test         # unit tests, no network needed
npm run build    # type-check + static build -> dist/
npm run verify   # render gate: the built app mounts (home + exact-trip + tour), no blank page
npm run test:e2e # end-to-end user journeys in headless Chromium against dist/ (needs build first)
```

The full check suite (`build` → `test` → `verify` → `test:e2e`) also runs in CI on every
pull request and push to `main` (`.github/workflows/test.yml`), and gates the Pages deploy.

## Docs & roadmap

- **[How it works](docs/how-it-works.md)** — plain-language tour of the app, its data, and why it runs free with no server or account.
- **[Algorithms](docs/algorithms.md)** — how it actually finds trains (free-seat filter, connections, one-pass sweeps, round trips, tours, station naming) with diagrams.
- **[Vision / roadmap](VISION.md)** — V1 today is SNCF, done well; V2 adds Deutsche Bahn, Renfe and more of Europe into the same search. Principles in [`specs/constitution.md`](./specs/constitution.md).

## Mobile app (Capacitor)

The same static app is wrapped as a native Android/iOS app with
[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/). The native build uses base `/` (assets
load from the app bundle, not the GitHub Pages sub-path), the service worker is
skipped on native, and the Android hardware back button navigates in-app history.

```bash
npm run cap:sync          # build for native (base "/") + copy assets & plugins into the platform
npx cap open android      # open in Android Studio to run / build an APK/AAB
```

The `android/` native project is already committed, so there's nothing to
generate first. (If it's ever deleted, `npm run cap:add:android` regenerates it.)

Requires the Android SDK / Android Studio to compile — the web build itself
needs only Node. To add iOS: `npm i @capacitor/ios && npx cap add ios`.

### Releases & F-Droid

Publishing a **GitHub Release** triggers the
[`Release Android APK`](.github/workflows/release-apk.yml) workflow, which builds
the app, signs it with the configured keystore and attaches the APK to the release
(it fails early if the keystore secrets are not set). The app is also packaged for
**F-Droid**, which builds and signs from source. Signing setup, the per-release version bump, and the F-Droid build
recipe are documented in **[docs/FDROID.md](docs/FDROID.md)**.

Contributions welcome — fork, `npm install`, `npm test`, then open a PR; principles in [`specs/constitution.md`](./specs/constitution.md).

## For agents / data API

Machine-readable and serverless — [`llms.txt`](public/llms.txt) and [`api.json`](public/api.json) describe the data + query API for AI agents.

- **Availability** — the deployed site serves `/data/tgvmax.json` (records where `od_happy_card: "OUI"` means a free MAX seat is reservable), plus `/data/meta.json` and `/data/stations.json`.
- **Deep-link search** — build a URL with `?mode=&from=&to=&date=&conn=…` (modes: `from`, `to`, `od`, `tour`, `best`). Full parameter list in [`api.json`](public/api.json).
